# SOC Test
## Instructions
1. Fork this repo
2. Write a small app that accepts a csv file as an upload. The csv file is a contact list. The contents of the list need to be inserted into a database. There needs to be a way to view and delete after the upload.
4. Either demonstrate in code or provide an explanation in this README on how you would handle very large files.
5. Either demonstrate in code or provide an explanation in this README on how you would handle different encodings.
6. Submit this as a pull request.

## Explanations!
4. Process row by row instead of reading it all at once.
5. Use the example in the python.org documentation, where you use `encode('utf-8')`.
